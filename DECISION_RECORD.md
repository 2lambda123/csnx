# Decision Records

## 1. Use Nx

- Nx has very good js/ts support, but is not limited to it
- the plugin architecture should mean we can bend it to our needs while getting the benefits of giving Nx something it understands
- It's been great in Source so far (https://github.com/guardian/source/pull/1342)
