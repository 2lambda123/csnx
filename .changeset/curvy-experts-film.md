Members of the `OphanAPIConfig` are now **required**. Consumers must pass a
record function, an error reporter and an object of server-side tests.

With the previously optional members, failure to record tests to Ophan would
fail silently. This has been the case in `dotcom-rendering` since Oct 2023.

In order to update your code to work identically, you must now provide the
following keys to the constructorâ€™s argument. They are listed here along with
the fallbacks previously applied:

- `serverSideTests` &rarr; `{}`
- `errorReporter` &rarr; `() => undefined`
- `ophanRecord` &rarr; `() => undefined`

Note that `errorReporter` has also been narrowed and it now receives a single
parameter, which is still `unknown` due to the fact than anything can be thrown.
