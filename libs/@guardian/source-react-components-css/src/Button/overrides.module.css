/*
An override .class and the default [attribute] selector would both have a
specificity of 1.

This means stylesheet source order comes into play.

To ensure the override class always takes precedence, we apply the override
class to the attribute, to get a specificity of 2.

This mimics how a consumer could apply their own styles.
