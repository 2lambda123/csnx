      # The Nx convention is to build packages to a root `dist` directory, but
      # changesets expects `dist` and `package.json` to live alongside the `src`
      # files in the standard workspace.
      #
      # Therefore, after building the packages we are going to publish, we will
      # rewrite the pnpm workspace file to point to the root `dist` directory instead.
      #
      # This will allow changesets to find the newly built assets to publish.
