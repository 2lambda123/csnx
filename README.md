Managed by [Nx](https://nx.dev/).

## Projects in the monorepo

### Packages

The following packages from `libs/*` are published to NPM:

<!-- START PACKAGES -->
<!-- THIS LIST IS AUTOGENERATED BY tools/scripts/maintain-readme.mjs -->

- [@guardian/eslint-config](libs/eslint-config)
- [@guardian/eslint-config-typescript](libs/eslint-config-typescript)
- [@guardian/prettier](libs/prettier)
- [@guardian/tsconfig](libs/tsconfig)

<!-- END PACKAGES -->

## Development

1. Clone the repo
1. Run a task.

## Running tasks

Tasks are defined in the [`Makefile`](./Makefile).

- `make build` builds all projects
- `make test` runs the tests for all projects
- `make lint` lints all projects
- `make fix` attempts to fix lint errors in all projects
- `make changeset` creates a new [changeset](https://github.com/changesets/changesets/blob/main/docs/intro-to-using-changesets.md)

> Note that the outputs of `build`, `test` and `lint` are [remotely cached by Nx](https://nx.dev/using-nx/mental-model#computation-hashing-and-caching), per project. This means only one iteration of a task (`build`, `test` etc) runs for a given state of a project, _ever_.
>
> For example, you're working on something, run the tests and they pass. Nx remotely caches the result. You push your changes to CI. When CI runs the tests, nothing has changed, so Nx fetches the (passing) cached results, the build goes green and you can merge. When I pull your changes, my copy of the code is identical to what you pushed and merged, so I _also_ get the cached results. If I then change the code, Nx re-runs the tests and, again, caches the results. 
>
> This happens _per project_. So if you change `project-a` but not `project-b`, Nx will get the cached results for `project-b`, but still run the tests for `project-a`. From then on, until `project-a` changes again, Nx will always use the cached results for both.
>
> This includes between development and CI, between pulls etc.

### Requirements

_You'll be prompted to install any missing requirements if they are needed..._

<!--
### When migrating an existing project into CSNX

- remove the current `.git` file from your existing project using `rm -rf .git` within the project root dir.
-->

## Troubleshooting

### Unable to commit

If you get a `command not found` error when commiting using a GUI (VSCode, GitHub desktop etc), add a `~/.huskyrc` file and load your Node version manager there.

For example, if you use [`fnm`](https://github.com/Schniz/fnm):

```sh
# ~/.huskyrc
eval "$(fnm env)"
fnm use
```

Or for [`asdf`](https://asdf-vm.com/):

```sh
# ~/.huskyrc (intel macs)
. /usr/local/opt/asdf/libexec/asdf.sh
```

```sh
# ~/.huskyrc (apple silicon)
. /opt/homebrew/opt/asdf/asdf.sh
```

See https://typicode.github.io/husky/#/?id=command-not-found for more info.
